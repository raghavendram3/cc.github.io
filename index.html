      <h1>Hey you! Yes, YOUü´µ! <br> Welcome to my page! </h1>

      <p> <b>Short Bio: </b><br> I am a PhD student at Wageningen University & Research (WUR), the Netherlands. I am enthusiastic about coupling computational tools with chemical/physical/materials science knowledge to gain insights into some of the most fundamental processes. Specifically, in my PhD, I am studying fundamental reactions involved in the conversion of biobased feedstock to platform chemicals for biofuels. The goal is to design cheap-and-efficient catalysts for biomass conversion. For this, I use knowledge of chemical/physical science and mathematical modeling to run computer simulations. For such simulations, the underlying theories are the widely used computational approaches like density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamics (MD), microkinetic modeling (MKM), etc. </p>
      <p> <b> Previous work:</b> <br>I did the master's thesis work under the guidance of Prof. dr. Michele Casula at Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris, France. I worked on the topic, ‚ÄúMagnetic properties of the narrowest zigzag graphene nanoribbons from ab initio calculations.‚Äù In this project, our goal was to shed light on the correct description of the ground state of the narrowest zig-zag nanoribbon. To do so, we used quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) as a high-level method providing benchmark results, and comparing its outcome with the most widely used Density Functional Theory (DFT). After doing extensive calculations, we came to the conclusion that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is the ground state of the narrowest zig-zag graphene nanoribbons. My primary research interests are in the field of computational Material Science (CMS) and theoretical & computational chemistry. Most of the projects I have done until now, involved packages based on DFT and QMC methods. Computational approaches have played a huge role in the discovery of novel materials and exploiting their properties which could be crucial on the route to face global challenges like the quest for efficient and sustainable use of energy resources. Also, it allows us to explore uncharted territories, which are not accessible via experimental work, in chemical and materials space, eg, to develop novel batteries, highly efficient solar cells, thermoelectric, magnetic materials, stable biocatalysts and carbon dioxide fixation strategies. However, I believe that experimental work always adds something to the theory and computation work as they go hand in hand.</p>
