         <p> Hi, my name is Raghavendra <em>aka</em> RV. I am a third-year PhD candidate at Wageningen University &amp Research.
         I have always wanted to build a website to put forward my thoughts in form of text-and-pictures about my research work
         on sustainable energy solutions, photographs of beautiful places I have visited, pretty 3-D images rendered by me in Blender, 
           and maybe some small blogs (about science, football, or philosophy) 
         in the near future, but definitely not limited to these topics. I can imagine that the things I listed here might appear to be random
         at first, but they surely have some connection. I think (ultimately) this platform will help me in expressing my thoughts on 
         connections between science, art, and sports. <br> In short, I do science, I love football, and I take photographs. 
         Besides these core domains, I like listening to music a lot (can't put a pin on a genre), reading a couple of books, and I am also learning
         to play guitar (gave up on piano a long time ago). I also like to paint, which I had done in my highschool, and I am 
           planning to pick it up again. However, my latest hobby is building this website, and 
         I work on it time-to-time.</p>
         <p>As of now, I have put my academic CV on 
         <a href="https://literallyscience.nl/cv.html">this</a> page. On the
         <a href="https://literallyscience.nl/photography.html">Photographs collection</a> page, I have uploaded the photographs I have
         taken during my trips around the world. In the near future, I plan to upload more than 100 more pictures and arrange these photographs 
           in a certain way, so it is easy to navigate through them.</p>
      <p> <strong>NOTE</strong>: please feel free to use the photographs I uploaded (just NOT for commerical purpose), and it is upto you if you feel
      like giving credits. Cheers, have a good day :)</p> <p style="text-align:center;">This website is under construction, and not optimized for
      mobile phones ⚠️ <br>Last updated on May 6, 2023.</p>
